             <br /> <br />
            <p class="paragraph">
                These specific data types are the ones already programmed into the
                C++ language which means you merely have to declare them and use them
                however you want. Some of them are the integral types that store data
                in whole numbers, the floating types that allow storage of decimal numbers,
                and the void type which is the only data type that does not return anything.
            </p>
             <br /> <br />
            <h3 class="subsubheaders">Integral Types</h3>
             <br /> <br />
            <h4 class="subsubheaders">Int</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The int datatype is one of the most common datatypes used in any language.
                It takes up 4 bytes in memory and thus can store whole numbers in the range
                of -2147483648 to 2147483647.
            </p>
             <br /> <br />
            <h4 class="subsubheaders">Char</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The char datatype is the type of container used in order to store all the
                characters in the alphabet, the characters of 0-9, as well as most symbols
                that can typed using a keyboard. This is why it only takes up 1 byte of memory
                and only has the range of -127 to 127 or 0 to 255. It is also often used to store
                RGB color values.
            </p>
             <br /> <br />
            <h3 class="subsubheaders">Floating Types</h3>
             <br /> <br />
            <h4 class="subsubheaders">Float</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The float datatype is often used to store number data with decimals in them.
                They take up a larger space in memory, needing 4 bytes, and thus they have
                the high range of +/- 3.4e +/- 38 (~7 digits).
            </p>
             <br /> <br />
            <h4 class="subsubheaders">Double</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The double datatype is an even bigger sized datatype to use when one wants
                to store a number that needs even bigger storage space. It takes up 8 bytes
                of data and thus has a range of +/- 1.7e +/- 308 (~15 digits).
            </p>
             <br /> <br />
            <h3 class="subsubheaders">Void Type</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The void datatype is unique that it is often only used in functions. It also cannot
                return anything when used.
            </p>
