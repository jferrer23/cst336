                C++ is one of the main programming languages in current existence and 
                therefore its vast details are important to learn for oneâ€™s career in 
                Computer Science. One of the most important details about C++, and all 
                other languages for that matter, are the datatypes they support. Datatypes 
                are very self-explanatory in that they are containers that can hold different 
                types of data. In this website, you will be able to learn about the main datatypes 
                available in C++ which can be categorized into three different types themselves. 
                The ones built in to the system, the ones that the user can create, and the ones 
                that can be derived from them both. Enjoy and have fun learning!
