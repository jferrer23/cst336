            <p class="paragraph">
                User defined datatypes are very self-explanatory in that they are data types
                that are created by the user. In this web page you will be able to learn
                a little about what structures, classes, and enumerations are, but also
                on how to create them in C++.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subsubheaders">Structure</h3>
             <br /> <br />
            <p class="paragraph">
                A data structure is a cluster of data pieces placed together under
                one name. These data elements, known as members, can have different types
                and different lengths. Data structures can be declared in C++ using the following
                syntax:<br />
                struct type_name {<br />
                member_type1 member_name1;<br />
                member_type2 member_name2;<br />
                member_type3 member_name3;<br />
                } object_names;
            </p>
             <br /> <br />
             
            <h3 class="subsubheaders">Class</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Classes are like an expansion of the idea of data structures: like data structures, 
                they can have data members, the difference is they can functions as data members also.
                An object is an instantiation of a class. In terms of variables, a class 
                would be the type, and an object would be the variable. 
                Classes are defined using either keyword class or keyword struct, with
                the following syntax: <br />
                class class_name {<br />
                access_specifier_1:<br />
                member1;<br />
                access_specifier_2:<br />
                member2;<br />
                } object_names;
            </p>
             <br /> <br />
             
            <h3 class="subsubheaders">Enumeration</h3>
             <br /> <br />
            <p class="paragraph">
              Enumerated types are types that are defined with a set of custom identifiers,
              known as enumerators, as possible values. Objects of these enumerated types can
              take any of these enumerators as value. Their syntax is: <br />
              enum type_name {<br />
              value1,<br />
              value2,<br />
              value3,<br />
              } object_names;
            </p>
