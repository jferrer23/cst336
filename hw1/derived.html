            <h2 class="subheaders">Derived DataTypes</h2>
             <br /> <br />
            <p class="paragraph">
                These datatypes specifically build upon the built-in datatypes in order to
                create data containers that can hold more of its self. The most known types
                of this category are arrays, functions, pointers, and references.
            </p>
             <br /> <br />
             
            <h3 class="subsubheaders">Arrays</h3>
             <br /> <br />
            <p class="paragraph">
                Arrays are the datypes used in order to store more data of the same type in a more
                efficient manner. This is done by stacking on top of the data types under one name.
                For example to make an array of five integers, we declare int values[3]. With this,
                what we are really declaring is create int value[0], value[1], value[2]. This way
                we can store related integers into one data holder.
            </p>
             <br /> <br />
             
            <h3 class="subsubheaders">Functions</h3>
             <br /> <br />
            <p class="paragraph">
                Functions are datatypes that once again use existing datatypes to store working code
                that return the datatype they derive from. With the exception of void which returns
                nothing, functions of type int or double will have to return the datatype they are
                based on which are int or double respectively.
            </p>
             <br /> <br />
             
            <h3 class="subsubheaders">Pointers</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Pointers are datatypes that hold the address of the variables of the datatype they are
                derived from. For example the pointer int* ptr = var holds the memory address of the
                variable var inside of the pointer variable ptr. This allows us to store the address
                and not the actual value of another variable of the type it points to for whatever
                reason.
            </p>
             <br /> <br />
             
            <h3 class="subsubheaders">References</h3>
             <br /> <br />
            <p class="paragraph">
               The reference datatypes simply allow us to view the address of variables inside of the
               memory of the device. By attaching the '&' symbol to the variable we will be able to
               access the address of the variable and not its contents.
